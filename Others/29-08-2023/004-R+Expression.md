## Which of the following regular expressions matches a string containing an odd number of 'a' characters, followed by any number of 'b' characters?
<pre>
A) (ab)*
B) (a+b)*
C) a*(ba*)*(ba*)*
D) a+(ba*)*
</pre>
## [?] Option(c) or (d)

Not Sure
The regular expression a*(ba*)*(ba*)* matches any string that starts with one or more "a" characters, followed by zero or more occurrences of the pattern "ba" repeated zero or more times. The pattern "ba" ensures that there is always an odd number of "a" characters in the string.<br>
By which it should be c<br>
But,<br>
a+: This part ensures that there is at least one 'a' character at the beginning.
(ba)**: This part allows for zero or more occurrences of 'b' characters followed by zero or more occurrences of 'a' characters. This allows for any number of 'b's and any number of 'a's after the initial 'a'.
This regular expression ensures that there is an odd number of 'a' characters because it starts with at least one 'a' and then allows for any combination of 'b' and 'a' characters, including zero 'a's. This pattern repeats, ensuring the 'a's remain odd in number.
