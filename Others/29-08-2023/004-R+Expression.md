## Which of the following regular expressions matches a string containing an odd number of 'a' characters, followed by any number of 'b' characters?
<pre>
A) (ab)*
B) (a+b)*
C) a*(ba*)*(ba*)*
D) a+(ba*)*
</pre>
Let's break down the regular expression `ab*c`:

- **ab**: This part of the regular expression means it's looking for an "a" immediately followed by a "b". So, it expects to see "ab" together.

- **c**: This part means it's looking for zero or more "c" characters.

Now, let's see if the string "acc" matches this regular expression:

1. The regular expression expects "ab" at the beginning of the string.
2. The string "acc" starts with "a," but the very next character is "c," not "b."

So, since "acc" doesn't start with "ab," it doesn't match the regular expression `ab*c`. The regular expression is specific about needing "ab" at the beginning of the string.

It's a bit tricky because it might seem like the regular expression is looking for "abc" in any part of the string, but it's actually focused on the start of the string, specifically "ab," followed by zero or more "c" characters.
