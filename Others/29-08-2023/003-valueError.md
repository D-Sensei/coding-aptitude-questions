### B) Invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc' (finally)

In this Python code, we have a try and except block. The code inside the try block attempts to convert the string "abc" into an integer using the int() function. However, since "abc" is not a valid integer, it raises a ValueError exception.

Because of the except ValueError part, Python knows how to handle this specific error. It assigns the string "ValueError" to the variable result.

Then, we have a finally block. The code inside the finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not. In this case, it appends " (finally)" to the result variable.

So, the final value of result is "ValueError (finally)," and that's what gets printed.
