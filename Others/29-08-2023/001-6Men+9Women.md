## 2 Men and 3 Women can complete a work in 15days. Then 6 men and 9 women can complete the same work in how many days ?
### Option C
> **2 men and 3 women can complete the work in 15 days.** This means that they can do 1/15 of the work in one day.
* **1 man's 1 day work** is the work done by 2 men and 3 women in one day, minus the work done by 3 women in one day. So, it is equal to (1/15) - (3/15) = 1/30.
> **6 men can do the same work in 6 days.** This is because 6 men can do 6 times the work done by 1 man in one day, which is 6 Ã— (1/30) = 1/5.
* **6 men and 9 women can complete the total work in 5 days.** This is because they can do 1/5 + 3/5 = 1 of the work in one day.

In other words, 6 men and 9 women can do the same amount of work in 5 days as 2 men and 3 women can do in 15 days.
