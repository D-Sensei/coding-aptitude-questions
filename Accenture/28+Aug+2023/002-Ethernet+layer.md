## Ethernet operates in which of the following
1. Physical layer<br>
2. Datalink layer <br>
3. Transport layer

a. 1&3
b. 2 &3
c. 1,2,3
d. 1&2

The answer is **(d) 1&2**.

Ethernet operates in the **physical layer (layer 1) and the data link layer (layer 2)** of the OSI model. It does not operate in the transport layer (layer 3).

The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural specifications for the physical transmission of data.

The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes. It provides error detection and correction, flow control, and addressing. Ethernet uses the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer to provide addressing and framing, and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer to provide error detection and correction and flow control.

The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end data delivery. It provides reliable communication between two hosts, even if there are errors in the data or if the network is congested. Ethernet does not provide this level of reliability, so it does not operate in the transport layer.

### So, the answer is **(4) 1&2**. Ethernet operates in the physical layer (layer 1) and the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model.
