## Solution
The given IP address 10.50.13.40 belongs to **Class A**.

IP addresses are divided into three classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C. The class of an IP address is determined by the first octet of the address.

* Class A IP addresses have the first octet in the range of 0 to 127.
* Class B IP addresses have the first octet in the range of 128 to 191.
* Class C IP addresses have the first octet in the range of 192 to 223.

The IP address 10.50.13.40 has a first octet of 10, which is in the range of 0 to 127. Therefore, it is a Class A IP address.

Here is a table summarizing the characteristics of the three IP classes:

Class | First Octet Range | Number of Networks | Number of Host per Network
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
A | 0-127 | 126 | 16,777,214
B | 128-191 | 16,384 | 65,534
C | 192-223 | 2,097,152 | 254
